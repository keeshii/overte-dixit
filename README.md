# Overte Dixit

The project implements the rules of the popular board game Dixit. The card images posted here have been generated by AI and are in no way related to the original Dixit game. The script was created as part of learning how to write scripts for the project [Overte VR](https://overte.org/).

## Installation

To add a game to your world, simply import the [dixit.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeshii/overte-dixit/master/dixit.json) file via Create App. This file defines the minimum number of objects needed to run the game.

The [dixit-world.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keeshii/overte-dixit/master/dixit-world.json) file additionally contains a skybox and a room with chairs. Both of these files were exported from blender with the `io_export_overte` plugin. You will find the blender source file in the `blender` folder.

## Unit tests

To run unit tests, nodejs dependencies must be installed.

```
npm install
```

Then run the `test` script:

```
npm run test
```
